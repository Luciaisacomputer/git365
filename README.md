# GitHub 365
The idea behind this is simple. Every day you work on a project or create a simple project for an entire year. For example you could build a website and keep adding to it, or you could create really simple apps each day. Nothing can be too big or too small for this. 

You don't have to have a project for each day, but you need to have a commit for each day. I wanted to start this as a way to make sure I am always using GitHub, and making a concious effort to contribute to the community. Hopefully other people will take this on and it will turn into something cool.
